## Film/TV

Film:

- [_The Shining_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shining_%28film%29): I watched it because it was a famous classic; it's very slow-moving movie which has the pacing problem of spending what seems like half the movie establishing the basic premise and then short-changes the descent into madness, which comes off as abrupt and unconvincing. The special effects are now tame enough that they're more amusing than frightening (the blood-hallway didn't inspire any unease in me, just some wondering how they did it - a miniature set which they could flood at will?) except for the rotting woman. I also couldn't get over how *strange* Shelley Duvall looks, and was a little offput by the [Magical Negro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_Negro) character. Still, the hotel is a great setting and the ending works nicely, so I'd call it a good film.
- [_The Secret Life of Walter Mitty_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_Life_of_Walter_Mitty_%282013_film%29) (2013 remake); pretty decent, albeit very little like story, and a rather shoehorned in quest/Blue Bird of Happiness which undermines original short story's protagonist by implying he was a failure before & the core dreaming was escapism

TV:

- [_The Wire_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire)

    Lives up to its fame (as long as you watch with subtitles), more than 12 years later. Satisfyingly intricate and intelligent police drama delving into the War on Drugs from a realistic point of view not blinded by idealism or unfounded confidence in police, courts, or governments like so many other shows which are based more on what writers think the audience wants to be true. Better than any other cop show I've watched. The filming on location in Baltimore helps realism for me, since I've wandered around Baltimore more than once. The downside is that the ~60 hours demands to be marathoned, and ate my month.

    The first season is perfect in its taut narrative from start to finish and illustrating the theme of _The Wire_: it's the incentives, stupid.

    There's a lot of discussion of _The Wire_ and praise for how it deals with racial themes, but this misses the mark - race is almost entirely irrelevant in the series, except occasionally as something fools are blinded by and can be manipulated with (such as how Clay Davis gulls voters and jurymen with racial rhetoric).
    What is important is how, black or white, male or female, everyone faces pressure from the system & reality to maximize pursuit of their assigned objectives, not the underlying latent goals.

    Everyone is 'juking the stats' and responding to incentives to the extent that the series is practically a primer on [public choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_choice): the police respond to overtime increases and pressure to fake the crime statistics; poorer people respond to demand from junkies to make easy risky money selling drugs; politicians respond to the pressure from myopic voters and their ambition for re-election or election to higher office to do what looks good rather than what is good; newspapers tolerate faked news for the potential awards; and everyone faces coordination problems posed by incentives. Stringer Bell & Avon Barksdale sell each other out, resulting in their death & incarceration respectively; two prisoners remain silent but one is tricked into thinking the other is talking and then defects; a stickup boy is tortured to death, not because anyone really wants to but to maintain deterrence; a young boy talks to police, but an error results in his defection being detected and punished; the mayor frantically argues with his advisers to maintain a successful drug legalization policy but his police chief interprets the delay as indicating the mayor is preparing to pin all the blame on him and defects to the newspapers, contributing to the mayor's electoral defeat; the next mayor asks for FBI help with a cluster of murders but that's outside the FBI's terrorism mission (FBI employees are not rewarded for making Americans safer but fighting 'the War on Terror') and he refuses the political sacrifice which would give them cover to help. Incentives pop up from the grand politics to the low interpersonal relationships: the political consultant won't sleep with the mayor when he's only a lowly councilman but the instant he's elected? Jumps on him the first moment they're alone.

    And this is all systemic, so it's not clear how it could ever be fixed. Anyone who claims to be a reformer may well decide to 'sell out' and respond to the incentives, as the season 3-5 mayoral arc illustrates. Real-world events since then have illustrated this: one of the saddest things about _The Wire_ is that there's only one thing in the _Wire_ world which actually seems to be done right and morally: the eponymous wiretaps. They have to show probable cause, they get it for limited times and purposes, barely abuse it at all, and have to fight to have it at all. When they do abuse it, it's in the service of a good cause, the abuse is discovered, and the culprits are punished more than most characters. And now here we are in 2014 with smartphones and Facebook and the endless Snowden revelations, and it all doesn't mean shit any more. All it took was one terrorist attack, and that was that. The politicians responded to the incentives.

    One of the things I like most is that almost none of this is spoonfed you: season 3 doesn't ever explicitly point out the parallel plots are Prisoner's Dilemmas in which both groups wind up defecting and reaching the worst outcome for most members, it expects you to infer this; similarly, when the white junkie kid ODs, it doesn't hammer his death in, just does a quick ~10 second bit of his body being found and you barely see his face; or when you see the police major at a gay bar, explaining why he has no family and is such a paranoid careerist, he's just a face in the background; or it establishes characters in bits which are almost invisible, such as in season 4 when the camera pans in on the ex-convict's boxing gym past a poster of Avon's photo up on the wall with the legend 'platinum club' - referencing the original photo in season 1 of Avon, and also requiring us to remember that Avon didn't want his sponsorship known because he was free but that he's back in jail now in this season and this is a comment on the boxer's loyalty. Timing can be established similarly, in the unremarked-upon upgrade of kids playing _Halo_ on Xbox to playing it on Xbox 360.

    There are some missteps. I disagree with the pollyanna-ish approach to inner-city school problems; the kids are pretty bad at playing _Halo_ - the SMGs are useless against close-in Elites, they should've been meleeing them; Stringer Bell misuses the concept of elasticity, confusing it with competitiveness/market-power; the Brother Muzon character was a bad idea, coming off like a a shonen or comic book monster-of-the-week character ('the nerd gunfighter!'); in contrast to the others, the gang boss Marlo is too opaque and it's unclear what motivates him besides sheer lust for power and an animalistic taste for conflict; season 2 wastes time on the Ziggy character who winds up contributing nothing; and I'm unsure the mayoral arc of season 3-5 *really* needed to last that long.
- [_Blue Blazes_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aoi_Hon%C5%8D)

    Live-action Japanese TV series, 11 half-hour episodes: quasi-autobiographical account of the manga artist [Kazuhiko Shimamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazuhiko_Shimamoto)'s university years as he flailed around, drew manga, and finally got a break in a magazine's contest. The mangaka himself isn't particularly notable - he did the [_Blazing Transfer Student_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hon%C5%8D_no_Tenk%C5%8Dsei) manga and apparently the _Anime Tenchou_ commercials, which are "hot blooded youth" bombastic fun heavy on sketchy art to convey intensity & drama & speed, but I had to look up his WP entry to realize that he was involved in those.

    The series is heavy on exaggerated emotion and facial reactions as the protagonist lurches from extremes of high and low, and draws on cringe-humor - you're laughing at the follies of his youth, not laughing with him. Tastes will vary for this kind of humor. Personally, I find some bathos is fine, but sustained over a series is a bit too much. The romantic subplots are also a misstep as they wind up being irrelevant, and inflicting a character on us whose voice is best described as a nasal whine.

    The *real* interest of _Blue Blazes_ is in the otaku culture depicted; it is stuffed with cameos (Hiroyuki Yamaga is the bartender in the scene about him forgetting to breathe; Toshio Okada plays Osamu Tezuka after Daicon; several manga editors have small parts), allusions and in-jokes, many of which I didn't even get (the episode intros are based on kyodai hero poses from Ultraman & other franchises, but I've never seen enough of them to recognize them) but some of which were hysterical (to me) - the manga club character dominates every scene he is in, eg after crushing the protagonist's dreams by critiquing his draft, remarks "One does not care to recall the mistakes of youth!" and rides away on his pink bicycle, declaring, "it's three times as fast!" (Char Aznable/_Mobile Suit Gundam_). In particular, I was surprised to learn that he had gone to the same university at the same time with some of the founders of Gainax, and it is depicting Hideaki Anno, Hiroyuki Yamaga, and the run-up to the DAICON films where it shines for me as it gives another perspective on early Gainax beyond [_The Notenki Memoirs_](http://www.gwern.net/docs/2002-notenki-memoirs). He apparently competed with them but was crushed; eg ep3 has Anno doing the Gendo pose after crushing everyone in animation (as expected from the master!). The character sketches are dead-on: when a room-mate's sister visits and Anno learns she has not seen _Mobile Suit Gundam_ and shows his hospitality by marathoning 12 episodes with her, one senses this is something that really happened and which his friends have never let him live it down. Other incidents are interestingly reflective of the times: getting a new VCR to allow stepping through home-videos of animated series frame by frame, to better understand them; visiting an animation supply shop just to watch a loop of anime series intros on their TV; passing out slowly and dramatically, imitating a tokusatsu; re-enacting a sea fight in the baths. The student films shown seem to either be the originals or shot-by-shot remakes. Other aspects are... odd. If episode 8 is remotely accurate, [Toshio Okada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toshio_Okada) was crazier than a bag of honey-roasted peanuts and his nouveau-riche family (with terrible decorating taste) made their money off blatantly counterfeiting money, which undermines my generally positive impression of him.

    Overall: a must-watch for anyone interested in Gainax; probably a good watch for anyone who liked _Bakuman_ or _Genshiken_; maybe a watch for anime fans; probably better skipped by anyone else.
